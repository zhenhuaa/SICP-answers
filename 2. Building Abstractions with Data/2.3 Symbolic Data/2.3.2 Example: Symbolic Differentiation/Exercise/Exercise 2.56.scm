Show how to extend the basic differentiator to handle more kinds of expressions. 
For instance, implement the differentiation rule
d(u^n) /dx =nu^(nâˆ’1)du /dx
by adding a new clause to the deriv program and defining appropriate 
procedures exponentiation?, base, exponent, and make-exponentiation. 
(You may use the symbol ** to denote exponentiation.) 
Build in the rules that anything raised to the power 0 is 1 and 
anything raised to the power 1 is the thing itself.
